// This line sets the view engine for your Express application to EJS (Embedded JavaScript). This means that when you render views/templates, Express will use the EJS engine to process and render them. With this setup, you can create dynamic HTML pages by embedding JavaScript code directly into your HTML files.

// This line adds middleware to your Express application to parse incoming request bodies with URL-encoded payloads. When a form is submitted with method="post" and enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded", this middleware will parse the form data and make it available in req.body object of the corresponding route handler. The extended: false option means that the parsed data will be represented as a nested object or array, rather than a more complex object.
